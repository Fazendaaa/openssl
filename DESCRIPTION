Description: Bindings to OpenSSL libssl and libcrypto, plus custom SSH pubkey parser.
    Supports RSA, DSA and NIST curves P-256, P-384 and P-521. Cryptographic signatures
    can either be created and verified manually or via x509 certificates. The common AES
    block cipher is used in CBC mode for symmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric (public
    key) encryption. The envelope functions combine RSA and AES for encrypting arbitrarily
    large data. Other utilities include key generators, hash functions (md5, sha1, sha256,
    etc), base64 encoder, a secure random number generator, and 'bignum' math methods for
    manually performing crypto calculations on large multibyte integers.
